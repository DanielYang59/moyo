# Moyo

## Goals
-  Find symmetry operations of a given crystal structure, identify its crystallographic group, and symmetrize the given crystal structure
- Well-defined tolerance for finding symmetry operations
- No dependency on existing symmetry-finder packages
- Simplify crystal symmetry algorithm by extensively exploit the group structures of crystallographic groups

## Non-goals
- Crystallographic groups in other than three dimensions
- Matching two similar crystal structures

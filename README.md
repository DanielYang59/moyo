# moyo

ðŸš§ This project is under construction ðŸš§

## Interfaces

- [Rust](moyo/README.md): core implementation
- [Python](moyopy/README.md)

## Goals

- Find symmetry operations of a given crystal structure, identify its crystallographic group, and symmetrize the given crystal structure
- Well-defined tolerance for finding symmetry operations
- No dependency on existing symmetry-finder packages
- Simplify crystal symmetry algorithm by extensively exploiting the group structures of crystallographic groups

## Non-goals

- Crystallographic groups in other than three dimensions
- Matching two similar crystal structures

## Acknowledgments

We thank Dr. Yusuke Seto for providing the crystallographic database.
